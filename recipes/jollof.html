    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This food is very delicious and eaten in mostly West Africa even though it is now crossing boundaries. 
        Very popular are the Ghanaian and Nigerian jollof. Currently there is a conflict between both countries about who's is best
    </p>
    <p>I will show you how to prepare just in case you are already salivating. </p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</p></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Tomato stew (Dont frown ok, you can google how to prepare if you want)</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Fried chicken</li>
        <li>Cooked beans (I like mine with beans)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the stew on fire for it to stimmer and add the vegetable to give flavour and colour</li>
        <li>After some time, please add a measurable amount of water depending on how many cups of rice you are cooking</li>
        <li>Allow to cook for about 15 minutes and pour your cups of rice into it and allow to cook</li>
        <li>Occasionally, stir and add water until evenly cooked. Becareful as there is this tendency that the food wont be evenly cooked  </li>
        <li> Now serve yourself and add the fried chicken.  Hey come here dont go yet. Oh, he is gone. </li>
    </ol>
