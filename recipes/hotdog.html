    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This food is very delicious and in Ghana here it is referred to as a cotinental dish.
       Well it is not what you are thinking. Well I understand that the name may seem as a dog meat but its not.  .</p>
    <p>I will show you how to prepare just in case you are already salivating. </p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</p></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Sausage meat</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>White Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bake the bread or buy one from a store. Well, how to bake bread is not part of my business now.</li>
        <li> Wrap the bread around the sausage meat. See, you have to wrap it well. Dont say I didnt tell you.</li>
        <li> Now, get the vegetables to fill the inside of the bread. This could be arranged nicely.</li>
        <li> Pour the cream on the whole structure now and slightly bake it </li>
        <li> You can now enjoy your hotdog. Not hot dog though </li>
    </ol>
